This directory contains scripts used in our manuscript "Y chromosome introgression between deeply divergent primate species" (Jensen et al. 2024).

Many scripts are also dependent on some of my general python parsing scripts:
https://github.com/axeljen/phylogenomics

After cloning that repo, you need to adjust the path in the Python scripts to point to the correct location of the scripts.

Other dependencies are listed in the readme's of the respective directories, which also contains more detailed documentation for each subsection.

These scripts were mostly written to be run on a SLURM cluster, where most software are installed as modules. They will need modification to be run on other systems.
