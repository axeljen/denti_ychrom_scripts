This directory contains scripts used in our manuscript "Breaking the rule: An exceptional Y chromosome introgression between deeply divergent primate species" (Jensen et al. 2024).

Many scripts are also dependent on some of my general python parsing scripts:

After cloning that repo, you need to adjust the path in the Python scripts to point to the correct location of the scripts.

Other dependencies are listed in the readme's of the respective directories.
